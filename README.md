## 🚨 SmartRelief

A full-stack *Smart Disaster Management & Relief Coordination System* designed to provide real-time alerts, affected-area analysis, and efficient relief coordination during natural or man-made disasters.

---

## ✨ Project Overview

*SmartRelief* helps authorities and users to:

* Report and monitor disaster situations
* Visualize affected areas and severity
* Coordinate relief resources efficiently
* Support decision-making using data-driven insights

The project integrates *frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)* with a *FastAPI backend, uses **data analysis / ML logic* for risk assessment, and supports structured data storage for reports and relief records.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 🚨 Disaster reporting & alerts
* 🗺 Affected area visualization
* 📊 Severity & risk analysis
* 🧠 Intelligent decision support (rule/ML-based)
* 📂 Centralized data storage
* 🌐 API-ready backend for frontend integration

## 🛠 Tech Stack

### Frontend

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

### Backend

* *Python*
* *FastAPI*
* REST APIs
* SQLite / PostgreSQL
* Pandas / NumPy

## 🧠 System Logic

* Disaster data is collected from users or authorities
* Severity levels are calculated using predefined rules or ML models
* High-risk areas are prioritized for relief planning
* Insights are served through APIs to the frontend
